# fake-and-real-news-detection
Fake and real news detection is a machine learning task that identifies whether a news article is truthful or misleading. It analyzes text patterns, linguistic features, and sources to classify news as real or fake.
📰 Fake and Real News Detection
This project uses Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to detect whether a news article is fake or real. In today's digital age, misinformation spreads rapidly across social media and news platforms. This tool helps identify and classify news content based on linguistic features, writing style, and source reliability.

💡 Key Features
Classifies news articles as FAKE or REAL

Uses TF-IDF vectorization to extract text features

Trained using models like Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, or Random Forest

Interactive web UI with Gradio for easy use

📁 Dataset
Sourced from the Fake and Real News Dataset available on Kaggle

Contains labeled news articles with titles and text for classification

⚙️ How It Works
Preprocessing: Cleans and tokenizes the text data

Feature Extraction: Converts text to numerical form using TF-IDF

Model Training: Trains on a labeled dataset to learn fake vs real patterns

Prediction: Accepts user input and predicts the authenticity of the news

🚀 Tech Stack
Python

Scikit-learn

Pandas & NumPy

Gradio (for frontend UI)

Google Colab / Jupyter Notebook

✅ Usage
Users can input a news article or headline into the web app, and the model will instantly classify it as fake or real, helping to combat misinformation online.
